I have a similar setup and faced a similar problem, but the solution I found was fairly simple. All of my PATH variables were already correct (from Python 3 the Windows Installer automatically does all of this).

The problem
The problem actually arises because of conflicting installations of virtualenv.

Fix
To address this problem you need to simply run the following commands:

First, remove your current version of virtualenv: pip uninstall virtualenv

Then, remove your current version of pipenv: pip uninstall pipenv

When you are asked Proceed (y/n)? just enter y. This will give you a clean slate.

Finally, you can once again install pipenv and its dependencies: pip install pipenv

This will also install the latest version of virtualenv.

Testing if it worked
Just enter pipenv --version in the command prompt and you should see the desired output.
